# Overview of How to Perform the Netflix Titles Analysis
## Step-by-Step Guide
### Data Collection

* Obtain datasets containing information about Netflix titles. For this analysis, we used titles.csv and credits.csv.
* Ensure the datasets include relevant fields such as title IDs, names, genres, ratings, release years, production countries, and roles of individuals involved.
Data Preparation

* Load the datasets into a data analysis tool or programming environment like Python with libraries such as Pandas.
* Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types where necessary.
* Merge datasets on common fields (e.g., title IDs) to create a comprehensive dataset.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Calculate summary statistics to understand the basic properties of the data (e.g., average scores, runtime).
* Visualize the distribution of key attributes such as genres, ratings, and release years.
### Genre Analysis

* Identify the most common genres.
* Calculate the average ratings and runtime for each genre.
* Visualize the top genres by count and average ratings using bar charts or other appropriate visualizations.
### Country Analysis

* Analyze the distribution of titles by production country.
* Calculate and visualize the average ratings for titles from different countries.
* Use maps and scatter plots to present the geographical distribution and rating comparisons.
### Release Year Trends

* Analyze the number of titles released each year.
* Calculate the average ratings per release year.
* Visualize trends over time using line charts to identify any patterns or significant changes.
### Role Analysis

* Identify the most prolific actors and directors by the number of titles.
* Calculate the average ratings for titles associated with top actors and directors.
* Visualize the top actors and directors by count and average ratings using bar charts and treemaps.
### Title Analysis

* Analyze titles by age certification to understand content suitability.
* Identify the top-rated titles by average IMDb scores.
* Examine the average number of seasons for TV shows.
* Visualize the distribution and ratings of titles by age certification and average scores.
### Regression Analysis

* Explore correlations between different variables such as IMDb scores, TMDB scores, and the number of votes.
* Calculate correlation coefficients to quantify relationships.
* Visualize the correlations using scatter plots with trend lines.
